Client Needs
  Query information based on facility, category of sites (school, church, OB, Peds)
  Outreach needs to be a running list of previous outreaches
    Outreach - date of outreach (1 column) + information about outreach (1 column)
  
  Have to be able to input outreach events
  Search a facilty : call location
    Update values based on facility
  Facility - UNIQUE ID
    Phone Number - Can Have Multiple, but just keep as one long text
  With the outreach, alert user for outreaches that haven't been completed in timeframe
    Timeframe should be able to be changed
    Such as "Look for schools that havent been contacted in 2 months"

  Need to able to create a new facility
    *Facility Name is only requirement

  Run reports of outreaches completed
    - Facilities completed
    - Date of outreach
    - What was outreached


  Start with OBs and Peds when reworking




  Clean way to put in information
  Want to search list of contacts that were done
  Want to be told if a contact hasn't been reached in more than 30 days
